# Online Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data on the OpenAI ProcGen Benchmark.

This repository contains the exam project of Jacob Bahnsen Schmidt (s184346) and Kasper Schou Telkamp (s170397) in the DTU course 02456 Deep Learning.

## Motivation

In this project we want to explore the world of generalization in Reinforcement Learning (RL) using Augmented Data and proximal policy optimization (PPO).  We want to investigate the benefits of using data augmentation for RL and compare performance across different models. Specifically we will focus on the CoinRun environment and train a model on a black background, that can generalize well on different backgrounds.

## Background

The ability to generalize to new environments is to this day a challenging problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL). In order to assist the research in this field, OpenAI have introduced a suite of 16 game-like environments designed to benchmark generalization in reinforcement learning. Furthermore the authors in [Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14990.pdf) propose a new strategy, Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data, to enhance the performance of the RL algorithms.
